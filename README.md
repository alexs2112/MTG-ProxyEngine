This is a WIP auto proxy tool for Magic: the Gathering that utilizes Scryfall APIs to establish a local database. Once the local database of all card information is created, the tool follows various templates to automatically construct proxy cards, formatted to be used with https://www.makeplayingcards.com/ for printing.

The goal is to have a fully functional user interface that allows the creation of several different sets of proxies based on user created templates that will be stored into an output folder generated by the engine.

For now, all currently implemented functionality (of which there is very little) is executed through the command line. python Engine.py -help will give more details.

Uses pygame for basic image processing. You may need to run the command "pip install pygame" from the command line
